### The project  
Design and develop a simple method for customers of a small scooter/moped shop to request and track service on their bikes, while also being able to track repair history.
					
### The team  
I carried the weight here. I was UX researcher and designer, UI designer, and front end developer. But since this project was a result of a experience my wife had with a shop, her input was crucial.

### Discovery
- Kick-Off  
	The first steps where to determine the points of frustration my wife had in her own experience.  
	I was going to to focus on the Service portion of this site so need input from her as to what she would have liked the process to look like.  
		These were primarily based around communication with the shop and conveying to them what repair had been done prior to them receiving it.
						
- Data Structure  
	Once the basic features were determined, I needed to work out data structure to use with Google Firebase to link the proper data to individual bikes while keeping in mind what information the shop would need when receiving them as I planned on building a custom view for them.  
	I wanted to ensure I could like repair history to each bike under a user's account along with any comments or requests pertaining to an individual repair.  
	
- Device Considerations  
	Initially, I built the product in a tablet layout thinking an iPad or other tablet would be a simple and portable format for both the end user and the shop.	
											
### Prototyping and Testing  
- Adobe XD Prototypes  
#### The problem  
I wanted to build a single page application with minimal changes to the UI for either the end user of the shop.  
#### The solution  
I stacked the navigation on the left hand side creating a content area on the right where I could dynamically change the content and use a simple color inversion to indicate a end user or shop user.  
###Design  
- Look and Feel  
	I wanted to incorporate some of the colors used by the shop I was using for inspiration on this project so I stuck with a pure red, black, and white.  
	I also wanted to introduce some typopgrahy and imagery to gently relate to elements of a moped such as the exterior heat sinks on the engine and the fork and wheel.
- UI Elements
	- UI element images
	- illustrations, custom icons, etc.  
### Takeaways  
- Plan, Plan, Plan  
	After further consideration, I determined the product would need a truly responsive setup to accomodate moped owners on the go who would likely use a mobile device, mechanics in the shop for whom a tablet would be well suited, and a web layout for shop administrators (should there be a time when they have one) and end users while at home.
